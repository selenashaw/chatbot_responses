# Errors.JSON
The error messages are split into two arrays, the first is called "general" which stores error messages that are already general, i.e. "unclosed string literal". The second array is called "parsed" and this is for error messages that need additional parsing, i.e. "incompatible types: String cannot be converted to an int"

Uh is that still true?? can I just do a general case for incompatible types???
